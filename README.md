# AiTrials
This repository contains a minimal, step-by-step implementation of a simple artificial neural network written entirely from scratch in Python â€” without using any machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn.

The goal is to deeply understand how machine learning models, especially single-layer perceptrons, learn through basic principles such as weight adjustment, error calculation, and iterative training.
